# Matching-Pairs
Matching pairs is a memory game where you need to match all similar tiles. The game starts with showing all the tiles randomly. Once all the tiles are flipped, then start trying to match the tiles. When all the tiles are matched the game finishes. I have used Pygame module for this game.
